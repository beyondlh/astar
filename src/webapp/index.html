<H2>Instructions</H2>
<P>This is a simple interactive implementation of the A* path finding algorithm.</P>
<H3>To test:</H3>

<UL>
    <LI>Hit the <B>go </B>button.
    <LI>Watch as the algorithm tries to find a route from the green dot to the red one.
</UL>

<H3>To load predefined maps:</H3>

<UL>
    <LI>Choose a <B>.grd</B> file from the <B>Load Map :</B> menu.
    <LI>Hit the <B>go </B>button.
</UL>

<H3>To test with your own map:</H3>

<UL>
    <LI>Hit the <B>clear</B> button. (Some junk may be left on the screen for now but it really has been cleared!)
    <LI>Select the <B>set start</B> option and choose a location on the grid. (it should turn green)
    <LI>Select the <B>set finish </B>option and chose a location on the grid. (it should turn red)
    <LI>Hit the <B>go </B>button.
</UL>

<H3>To set up obstacles/paths:</H3>

<UL>
    <LI>Select the <B>set blocks</B> option.
    <LI>Choose a level for the blocks from the menu underneath
        <UL>
            <LI><B>Impossible</B> : No route can pass through this cell. (<I>might be water in a game</I>)
            <LI><B>Very Tough</B> : Going through this cell is hard going (<I>might represent mountains in a game</I>)
            <LI><B>Tough </B>: Going through this cell is quite hard (<I>might represent a hill or forest in a game</I>)
            <LI><B>Easy</B> : Going through this cell is easier than a normal square (<I>might be a road in a game</I>)
        </UL>
    <LI>Click on the grid to set blocks (click on a block again to clear it)
    <LI>Set the start and end points as above.
    <LI>Hit the go button.
</UL>

<H3>To install on your own system</H3>
<P><A HREF="astar.zip">astar.zip</A> contains all of the class and java files you need as well as some example
    maps.<BR>
    You can run AStarApplet.class both as an applet and as an application.<BR>
    As an application you can save new maps.<BR>
    <I>(right click on the above link and choose 'save link as' if Netscape gets confused)</I></P>
<H3>To make me happy (or sad)</H3>
<P>Send me some <A HREF="mailto:j.macgill@geog.leeds.ac.uk">feedback</A>.</P>
<H2>About the A* algorithm</H2>
<P><I>(A quick overview for now, I'll go into more depth later)</I></P>

<P>The algorithm searches outwards from the start point adding up the cost of traversing each cell.<BR>
    It stores the distance each cell is from the start point and moves on.<BR>
    When it reaches the end point it searches back, looking for the cell with the shortest distance from the start
    each step.</P>
<H2>Notes:</H2>
<P>The applet has been deliberately slowed down so that you can see what is going on.<BR>
    There are now two methods available: <B>Clasic A*</B> which works properly and <B>Old</B> (my fist attempt) which
    dosn't.<BR>
    It always finds a route if one is possible (I think) <BR>
    <B>Old </B>may appear to operate faster than <B>Clasic </B>but this is an artifact of the animation and not a reult
    of the methods efficiency.</P>
<H2>Improvements</H2>
<P>Add additional path finder methods.<BR>
    Add more predefined patterns.</P>
